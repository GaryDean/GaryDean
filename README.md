## About Me

Born and raised in [Perth, Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth) (pre-[Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1) era!), I grew up in a mono-cultural English/British suburban environment. My journey later led me across South East Asia, and since 1996, Indonesia has been my home and citizenship.
